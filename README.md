Hello, I'm Ginanjar. My fascination towards data science brought me here to GitHub. I'm a metallurgical engineer by trade and have been working in the manufacturing industry for the past couple of years. I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills in transforming data into meaningful insights, awesome predictions, and pretty visualizations.

Here are the languages and tools that I use for my data projects:

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-FFE873?style=flat&logo=python)
![Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Jupyter-orange?style=flat&logo=jupyter&logoColor=white)
![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MySQL-00758F?style=flat&logo=mysql&logoColor=F29111)
![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/-R-276DC2?style=flat&logo=R)
![Tableau](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Tableau-white?style=flat&logo=tableau&logoColor=blue)

When not cleansing data or tuning models, I'm probably nose-deep in a book, or binging tearjerking K-dramas, or desperately pushing rank on Mobile Legends.
